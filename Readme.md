## Installation

Super simple. Just drag & drop DDImageView.h/.m into your project. In your Project, find the .xib or .storyboard file and go to the Identitiy inspector of your NSImageView. Just enter DDImageView in the Custom Class Textfield and you should good to go.

## Usage

If you want to support other or more files then just images have a look in 
```
-(BOOL)performDragOperation:(id <NSDraggingInfo>)sender { ... }
```
and change the NSPasteboard Types.

If you want to change the label "Drop Image Here" have a look at the
```
-(void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect { ... }
```
## ARC

This version uses only ARC. If you still use MRC in your project feel free to fork this project. Also you will get 1 error by first start of the project. This is because it will recognize that you do not use ARC and will give you a solution how to implement this arc file in your non-arc project.
